# PersonalKnowledge
This repository contains my personal notes on the main topics I'm interested in. The repo includes, PDFs with the notes and code used to learn the topics.


## Deep Learning ðŸ¤–
The Deep Learning folder contains both notes and code about most popular deep learning architectures such as Transformers (and their variations) and CNNs. The Pytorch code was developed starting from online tutorials (mainly [Pytorch Full Course video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_xro1bcAuA&t=53736s)) and modified for self-practice. I strongly reccommend to check both the indicated resources and the official [Pytorch Documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html).

To run the `main.ipynb` code, first run the following commands to create a python virtual environment with the needed libraries:
```ssh
cd DeepLearning/Pytorch/

# Create the venv
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
